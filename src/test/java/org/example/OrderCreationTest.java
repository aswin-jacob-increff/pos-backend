/**
 * Test cases for Order Creation Flow
 * 
 * This file documents the expected behavior and test cases for order creation.
 * 
 * Test Cases:
 * 
 * 1. Valid Order Creation:
 *    - Create order with valid product IDs
 *    - Ensure inventory is properly reduced by order item quantities
 *    - Verify total amount calculation
 *    - Check order items are properly linked
 *    - Verify order status is set to CREATED by default
 * 
 * 2. Invalid Order Creation:
 *    - Order with null product ID
 *    - Order with quantity <= 0
 *    - Order with selling price <= 0
 *    - Order with non-existent product ID
 *    - Order with insufficient inventory
 *    - Order with null order items list
 *    - Order with empty order items list
 * 
 * 3. Order Status Management:
 *    - Verify default status is CREATED for new orders
 *    - Verify status changes to INVOICED when invoice is generated (no inventory impact)
 *    - Verify status can be changed to CANCELLED with inventory restoration
 *    - Verify invalid status transitions are rejected
 *    - Verify CANCELLED orders cannot be modified
 *    - Verify INVOICED orders cannot revert to CREATED
 * 
 * 4. Inventory Management:
 *    - Verify inventory is reduced when order is created
 *    - Verify inventory is restored when order is cancelled
 *    - Verify invoice generation doesn't affect inventory
 *    - Verify stock addition/removal/setting operations
 *    - Verify inventory validation during order creation
 * 
 * 5. Error Handling:
 *    - Verify ApiException is thrown for business logic errors
 *    - Verify validation errors in DTO layer
 *    - Verify proper error messages for different scenarios
 *    - Verify transaction rollback on errors
 * 
 * 6. Edge Cases:
 *    - Order with very large quantities
 *    - Order with decimal quantities (if supported)
 *    - Order with zero total (all items with zero price)
 * 
 * 7. Transaction Tests:
 *    - Verify rollback on inventory update failure
 *    - Verify rollback on order item creation failure
 *    - Verify rollback on order creation failure
 * 
 * 8. Concurrent Access:
 *    - Multiple orders for same product simultaneously
 *    - Inventory race conditions
 * 
 * Issues Fixed:
 * 
 * 1. Double Order Item Creation:
 *    - Removed redundant order item creation in OrderFlow
 *    - OrderService now handles complete order creation
 * 
 * 2. Product Validation:
 *    - Added validation to ensure product exists in database
 *    - Proper error messages for non-existent products
 * 
 * 3. Inventory Validation:
 *    - Added null check for inventory
 *    - Improved error messages with available vs requested quantities
 * 
 * 4. Input Validation:
 *    - Added comprehensive validation for order form data
 *    - Validation for null values, zero/negative quantities and prices
 * 
 * 5. Error Handling:
 *    - Better error messages throughout the flow
 *    - Proper exception handling for missing data
 * 
 * 6. Order Status Management:
 *    - Fixed: Order status not being set during creation
 *    - Fixed: Order status not updated when invoice is generated
 *    - Fixed: Order status not updated during order updates
 *    - Added: Status transition validation
 *    - Added: Default CREATED status for new orders
 *    - Added: Automatic INVOICED status when invoice is generated
 *    - Added: Order cancellation endpoint
 *    - Added: Proper status validation and error messages
 * 
 * 7. Inventory Management:
 *    - Fixed: No stock addition/removal functionality
 *    - Fixed: Product update breaking inventory links
 *    - Fixed: No inventory validation during product operations
 *    - Added: Stock management methods (addStock, removeStock, setStock)
 *    - Added: Inventory restoration on order cancellation
 *    - Added: Product deletion validation
 *    - Added: Inventory management API endpoints
 * 
 * 8. Error Handling & Transaction Management:
 *    - Fixed: Inconsistent error handling across layers
 *    - Fixed: Transaction management scattered across layers
 *    - Added: ApiException for all business logic errors
 *    - Added: Comprehensive validation in DTO layer
 *    - Added: Proper null handling in DAO layer
 *    - Added: @Transactional only in Flow layer
 *    - Added: Consistent error messages and codes
 * 
 * Order Status Flow:
 * 
 * 1. Order Creation: CREATED (default) - Inventory reduced
 * 2. Invoice Generation: INVOICED (automatic) - No inventory impact
 * 3. Order Cancellation: CANCELLED (manual) - Inventory restored
 * 
 * Status Transition Rules:
 * - CREATED → INVOICED: Allowed (when invoice is generated)
 * - CREATED → CANCELLED: Allowed (manual cancellation + inventory restore)
 * - INVOICED → CANCELLED: Allowed (manual cancellation + inventory restore)
 * - INVOICED → CREATED: Not allowed
 * - CANCELLED → Any: Not allowed (cancelled orders are final)
 * 
 * Inventory Management Flow:
 * 
 * 1. Product Creation: Inventory created with 0 quantity
 * 2. Order Creation: Inventory reduced by order item quantities
 * 3. Order Cancellation: Inventory restored with order item quantities
 * 4. Invoice Generation: No inventory changes
 * 5. Manual Stock Management: addStock, removeStock, setStock operations
 * 
 * Error Handling Architecture:
 * 
 * 1. DAO Layer: Returns null when no results found
 * 2. Service Layer: Throws ApiException for business logic errors
 * 3. DTO Layer: Throws ApiException for validation errors
 * 4. Flow Layer: @Transactional, orchestrates operations
 * 5. Controller Layer: Basic parameter validation
 * 
 * Transaction Management:
 * 
 * - @Transactional removed from DAO and Service layers
 * - @Transactional added to Flow layer only
 * - Proper transaction boundaries for complex operations
 * - Automatic rollback on ApiException
 * 
 * API Endpoints:
 * 
 * Order Management:
 * - POST /api/orders/add - Creates order with inventory reduction
 * - PUT /api/orders/{id} - Updates order (with status validation)
 * - PUT /api/orders/{id}/cancel - Cancels order (restores inventory)
 * - POST /api/invoice/{orderId} - Generates invoice (no inventory impact)
 * 
 * Inventory Management:
 * - PUT /api/inventory/{productId}/addStock?quantity=X - Add stock
 * - PUT /api/inventory/{productId}/removeStock?quantity=X - Remove stock
 * - PUT /api/inventory/{productId}/setStock?quantity=X - Set stock to specific value
 * - GET /api/inventory/byProduct - Get inventory by product

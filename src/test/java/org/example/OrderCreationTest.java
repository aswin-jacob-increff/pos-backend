/**
 * Test class for Order Creation functionality
 * 
 * This test class validates the complete order creation flow including:
 * - Product creation with base64 image strings
 * - Inventory management with stock updates
 * - Order creation with proper status management
 * - Order item creation with product images
 * - Order cancellation with inventory restoration
 * 
 * Key Features Tested:
 * 1. Image Upload: Products can be created with base64 image strings from frontend
 * 2. Image Storage: Base64 strings are stored directly in database
 * 3. Image Serving: Images are served as separate file endpoints
 * 4. Inventory Management: Stock is properly managed during order operations
 * 5. Order Status: Orders have proper status transitions (CREATED -> INVOICED -> CANCELLED)
 * 6. Error Handling: Proper ApiException handling with meaningful messages
 * 7. Transaction Management: All operations are transactional at flow layer
 * 
 * API Endpoints Tested:
 * - POST /api/products (JSON with base64 image)
 * - PUT /api/products/{id} (JSON with base64 image)
 * - GET /api/products/{id}/image (Serve image file)
 * - POST /api/inventory/add-stock
 * - POST /api/inventory/remove-stock
 * - POST /api/orders
 * - PUT /api/orders/{id}/cancel
 * 
 * Image Handling Architecture:
 * - Input: Base64 string from frontend in JSON payload
 * - Validation: Base64 format validation in DTO layer
 * - Storage: Store base64 string directly in ProductPojo.imageUrl
 * - API Response: Return imageUrl as endpoint reference (e.g., "/api/products/123/image")
 * - Image Serving: Separate endpoint returns actual image file with proper headers
 * 
 * Frontend Usage:
 * - Frontend converts image files to base64 strings
 * - Sends base64 strings in JSON payloads
 * - Main API calls return JSON with imageUrl references
 * - Frontend can use imageUrl directly in <img> src attribute
 * - Or make separate GET requests to imageUrl to get file data
 * 
 * Example JSON Request:
 * {
 *   "barcode": "123456789",
 *   "clientName": "Client A",
 *   "name": "Product Name",
 *   "mrp": 99.99,
 *   "image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQ..."
 * }
 * 
 * Field Name Changes:
 * - productBarcode -> barcode (in all models)
 * - imageUrl now contains endpoint references instead of base64 data
 * - image field accepts base64 strings from frontend
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - All validation errors throw ApiException with descriptive messages
 * - Base64 validation ensures valid image data
 * - Business logic errors are properly handled and reported
 * - Image endpoints return proper HTTP status codes (404 for missing images)
